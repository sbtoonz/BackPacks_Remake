## This Mod adds 3x wearable backpacks to the game

#### This mod comes with 3x wearable bags, The concept was to replace Jotunn backpacks as the code for that mod is no longer being maintained;

### The bag types this includes is:
 1) Leather Bag. This bag has a small number of slots and can be crafted early on in the game with some DeerHide and LeatherScraps.
 2) Iron Bag: This bag has quite a few more slots to keep your things in. It requires Iron to craft so you have had to make it to the swamps to see this one !
 3) Silver Bag: This bag is probably the nicest one you can make. It has the largest capacity


Some details about the bags.
All bags have dynamic inventory that is per bag per world.
You can't store a bag in a bag.

You can't teleport with unteleportable items in your bag even if you unequip your bag and stick it in your inventory. 

This mod also has support for Jude's equipment. If you have that mod installed the backpacks from Jude's equipment will now have inventories you can interact with.

This mod is a ServerSync'd mod and is required to live on the server as well as the client who uses it.

To bring up the bag's inventory you must 
1) Have bag equipped
2) Have inventory up and visible
3) Press LeftShift + E 
4) View bag contents
